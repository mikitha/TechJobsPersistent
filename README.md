# TechJobsPersistent

This project was part of the LaunchCode LC101 course, specifically Unit 2: C# + SQL + ASP.NET MVC. The object was to take an existing code base and build out a job search webapp. At the start of the unit, this was a console program, but as we learned more about C# and how MVC works we were able to expand it into a functional webapp with a persistent SQL database to hold the jobs created by the user. Several concepts from the class were brought together to create the final webapp, including Inheritence, Polymorphism, Routing, Razor Views, Models & Model Binding, Databases & SQL, and Object-Relational Mapping. 

This Job Search Web App features:
-Filtered Searching (by location, skill, employer, or keyword)
-Create or Delete a Custom Job
